-- Data-repair script (NOT a schema migration) for employees with an
-- unassigned house_id.
--
-- IMPORTANT:
-- Run this script only after the backend fix that prevents house_id
-- from being cleared during employee updates has been deployed.
--
-- The house_id is recomputed using the same deterministic formula used
-- by houseIdForEmployeeId for employee IDs with a valid numeric suffix.
--
-- Only rows with a NULL house_id are updated; existing house assignments
-- are preserved.

UPDATE employee
SET
    house_id = (
        CAST(REGEXP_REPLACE(employee_id, '^[^0-9]*', '') AS UNSIGNED) % 4
    ) + 1,
    updated_by = 'system-data-repair'
WHERE house_id IS NULL
  AND employee_id REGEXP '^[^0-9]*[0-9]+$';
