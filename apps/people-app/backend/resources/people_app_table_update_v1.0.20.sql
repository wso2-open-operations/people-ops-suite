-- Prevent an employee record from linking continuous_service_record to its own id.
-- A CHECK constraint isn't usable here: MySQL rejects CHECK constraints that
-- reference an AUTO_INCREMENT column (Error 3818, `id` is AUTO_INCREMENT), so
-- this is enforced with BEFORE INSERT/UPDATE triggers instead.
