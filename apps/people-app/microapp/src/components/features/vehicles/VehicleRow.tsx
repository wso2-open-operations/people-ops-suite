/**
 * VehicleRow Component
 *
 * Displays a single vehicle entry in a list, showing its type, number, and index.
 * Includes a toggleable options menu (with delete functionality) triggered by the More icon.
 *
 * Handles selection state to reveal the `MoreOptions` panel and supports vehicle deletion
 * via a mutation. Visual styling adjusts based on whether the row is active or selected.
 *
 * Props (VehicleRowProps):
 * - id: number – unique identifier for the vehicle (used for deletion)
 * - index: number – position of the vehicle in the list (displayed to user)
 * - type: "CAR" | "MOTORCYCLE" – vehicle type (used to display appropriate icon)
 * - number: string – license plate or vehicle number
 * - selected?: boolean – whether the row is currently selected (i.e., showing options)
 * - active?: boolean – whether the vehicle is currently active (used to dim non-selected rows)
 * - onDelete: () => void – callback after successful vehicle deletion
