-- Leave App v1.2.0
-- France leave types: Compassionate Leave and Other Authorized Leave (the latter needs lead approval),
-- plus an encrypted sick note attachment for France sick leave. leave_attachments holds the AES-GCM
-- encrypted note (one per leave), leave_attachment_downloads audits every download, and the two new
-- leave_submissions columns drive the approval reminder and store the rejection reason.
